The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)

   - 1 Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, 
   a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, 
   and sets the respective class properties to these values.

   - 2 The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

   - 3  Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, 
   and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". 
   You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.

   - 4  Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”,
